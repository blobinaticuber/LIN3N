# About LIN3N

This is a program that simulates an N-dimensional 3-layered Rubik's Cube puzzle. By projecting the puzzle into a 1-dimensional fractal representation, all stickers that make up a single piece are connected to each other, increasing piece readability at the sacrafice of puzzle coherency.
